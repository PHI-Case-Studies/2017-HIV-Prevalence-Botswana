    "Data and information are the lifeblood of public health. Rapid advances in information and communications technology are creating profound changes in how public health workforce collects, manages, shares, analyzes and uses data and information, at the molecular, organ, patient and population levels, to inform decision-making and improve health outcomes. Designing, implementing and reproducing these value-generating processes require inter-disciplinary knowledge and skills, collaborative problem solving and systems thinking. Case studies have been used in many disciplines (health sciences, social sciences, engineering and law), to create opportunities to provide learners with immersive environments in which to apply these problem solving skills. Digital case studies provide the additional benefits of interactivity and reproducibility to data science problems. Educators new to adoption of digital case studies may be faced with challenges understanding the ecosystem of tools that can be used before even starting to develop digital case studies. This workshop introduces participants to development and use of digital case studies in public health using Jupyter Notebook, an open source data science platform for working with reproducible, shareable computational narratives about problem solving in public health informatics."

    "Participants will be guided through the creation of a case study using Jupyter Notebook. A case study using public available Botswana HIV prevalence data will be developed and separated into various components like “puzzle pieces”. Workshop participants will be divided into teams and tasked with developing a comprehensive picture of the HIV prevalence impact in Botswana by putting the puzzle pieces together. Ultimately, there may be multiple versions of this case study that will be narrated and presented by individual teams. Resulting in participants gaining hand-on experience for problem solving using Jupyter notebook."
