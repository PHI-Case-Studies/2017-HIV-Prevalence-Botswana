# 2017-HIV-Prevalence-Case-Study Building Blocks

*This repository was created for use by CDC programs to collaborate on public health surveillance related projects in support of the CDC Surveillance Strategy. Github is not hosted by the CDC, but is used by CDC and its partners to share information and collaborate on software.*

Case studies have been used in many disciplines (health sciences, social sciences, engineering and law) to create opportunities to provide learners with immersive environments in which to apply these problem solving skills. Digital case studies provide the additional benefits of interactivity and reproducibility to data science problems, but educators be faced with challenges understanding the ecosystem of tools that can be used to develop them. Over the course of the next few hours, you and your team will develop a simple digital case study based on publically-available data from Botswana. The focus of this case study will center on HIV prevalance in Botswana using three building blocks: person, place and time.

## Interact with the Case Study
[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-HIV-Prevalence-Botswana/master) 

You will build a **digital case study** with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Click on the Binder Notebook link above. Wait a few minutes for the Binder service to complete its setup and launch. Enjoy the rest of the story after you launch the case study.

## Use a custom Docker-based Jupyter Notebook Server (during workshop)
1. Obtain a GitHub account.
2. Note down your GitHub log in credentials (user name and password).
3. The workshop facilitators will guide you during the log in process to this custom Jupyter Notebook server. (You may try to set this up on your local machine using the code from this repository: https://github.com/PHI-Toolkit/jupyterhub-deploy-docker-localhost.git. Note you may need to set up Docker and its associated tools to make this happen, and it may require you to have a local machine with the right hardware and software requirements.)
4. Once you have set up and launched the Docker-based Jupyter Notebook server, and have logged in, launch a terminal from within the Notebook Server and clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-HIV-Prevalence-Botswana.git`.
5. You can then launch the case study notebooks with minimal configuration (may need to `pip install camelot-py` and other required packages using a Jupyter Notebook terminal window.

## Use Anaconda Jupyter Notebook - Steps
1. Download and install Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Clone this repository. In a Windows Powershell window, or MacOSX or Linux terminal window, type `git clone https://github.com/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-HIV-Prevalence-Botswana.git`. You may need to install `git` before this.
4. In the same terminal or Powershell window, type `cd 2019-HIV-Prevalence-Botswana`, then type `anaconda.sh` for MacOSX or Linux, or `anaconda.ps1` for Windows Powershell. This creates a special kernel (virtual environment) called `case-python3` that contains all the Python packages needed for this case study. 
5. Launch Anaconda-Navigator, then launch Jupyter Notebook
6. Navigate to the folder where the cloned repository was downloaded.
7. Launch Notebook 0. Then using the Notebook menu, go to "Kernel" then "Switch Kernel" - select `case-python3`. Switch to this kernel when you launch the other notebooks from this case study.

## Notes
### Using BinderHub
After clicking on the "launch binder" link above, wait for a few minutes to have Docker container built.
